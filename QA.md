## QA-1 
```bash
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of a Progressive Web App, compared to a
basic web app and a mobile app ? And in what context would you recommend it ?
```

Pros and cons of a PWA are well known in the world. You can just get it answered in one time google search.
Summarizing them in my own words, it is as below:

- Pros 
1. Hybrid of a website and a mobile app.
2. In terms of performance, the speed is better than a basic website.
3. Excepting the native app stores, You can use a PWA like native app with running on home screen, getting push notifications, hiding the browser UI controls, smooth animations, full screen experience and offline work.
4. Comparing with native app, accessing the PWA app is a one-step process. Accessing the Native app is more complicated than the PWA that can be accessed by clicking on URL.
5. PWA doesn't need the platform compatibilities like a Native app.
6. It can save you money and time.

- Cons
1. PWA doesn’t have the capability to communicate with other apps installed.
2. In terms of performance, a PWA works slower than a Native app.
3. It needs access to the Internet and will drain the battery faster.
4. Instead of not requiring platform compatibilities, PWA doesn’t have support for any browser that is not supported by HTML5.

- Recommend
I will usually recommend PWA if you need to choose between PWA and a web app.
Comparing to a Native mobile app, it depends on the purpose of the app.
FI, in case of the Voice Trip app, I will definitely recommend PWA because it is a eCommerce web app.

## QA-2 
```bash
What are the advantages and disadvantages of AMP ? And in what context would you
recommend it ?
```

AMP will be perfect for you to let the users instantly access the content that matters to them.

- Pros
1. Web pages get easily cached and loaded
2. Page load time decreases to less than 1 second, giving 4 times faster page load
3. Is especially useful for content-based websites

- Cons
1. No Javascript allowed
2. User activity can not be tracked
3. Can't enhance the search engine ranking
4. No suitable for e-commerce sites
Apart from these, there are still other technical disadvantages

- Recommend
It also depends on the purpose of your app.
It is suitable for content-based websites but not for ecommerce websites.
If you can use both of them, it would be great but not sure if it can take much efforts technically.

## QA-3
```bash
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of Vue-Storefront ? And in what context
would you recommend it ?
- How would you extend Vue-Storefront to respect its architecture ?
```

As a PWA app, Vue-Storefront is an outstanding tool in the Ecommerce category.

- Pros
1. Fast and clean code
2. Super easy to show the app working to the customers
3. Good performance and UX
4. Payment gateway implementation is strait forward. It has Paypal and Stripe, Braintree integrations

- Cons
1. As it is new tech, it still has some minor bugs and not supported powerfully like React.

- Recommend
I would strongly recommend this tool for Ecommerce web app. It would be great if you can easily mix a AMP to your PWA app.


Based on my knowledge about Vue Storefront, the most important is to choose existing default VS theme.
And then you can customize it by integrating VS plugins and components like element-ui, microcart, etc.
